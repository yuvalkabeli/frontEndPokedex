# Pokedex Web Application

## Overview

- **User Authentication**: Users can log in to track their caught Pokemon and manage their collections.
- **Interactive Pokemon List**: Hovering over a Pokemon image switches its picture from front to back view.

## Technology Stack

- **Backend API**: Calls handled through axios for fetching and managing Pokemon data.
